## Steps to install

* Backup your personal data and IMEI
* Check your partition table layout A or A/B (depending on Stock used 8.1 or 9) with [Treble Info](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tk.hack5.treblecheck) app and choose correct system image

> To go into fastboot or recovery keep `Vol+` and `power` down when starting your phone

* Install TWRP (after flashing don't reboot into the main system)
  * **Fastboot** :  
    * Install Mediatek USB driver and adb/fastboot utilities  
    * Open a console in the fastboot utility's folder  
    * Reboot your phone into fastboot and plug it
    * Unlock bootloader (or flashing non-critical partitions), flash TWRP image, lock back (optional?), reboot into the recovery:  
`fastboot oem unlock`<br>
`fastboot flash recovery recovery.img`<br>
`fastboot oem lock`<br>
`fastboot reboot recovery`<br>
or<br>
`fastboot flashing unlock`<br>
`fastboot flash recovery recovery.img`<br>
`fastboot reboot recovery`<br>

  * **SP Flash Tool** :
    * Download and install MediaTek VCOM driver and SPFlashTool
    * Download Stock Image
    * In SPFlashTool go to the download tab and load the scatter file of the stock rom `MT6771_Android_scatter.txt`
    * Uncheck everything except recovery and change the recovery.img to the TWRP one.
    * Click `Download` and connect your powered off phone and let the flash go until green check-mark.
* Reboot directly into recovery and flash [Magisk](https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445) if you want to go into the stock rom.   
  Without Root, stock rom remove TWRP and install back stock recovery!
* Boot into recovery:
  * Factory Wipe (data/cache/dalvik) + System
  * Flash correct phh-treble System image
  * [Optional] Copy [**treble-overlay-Blackview-BV9600Pro.apk**](https://github.com/Mel-kior/BV9600Pro_Overlay/raw/master/treble-overlay-Blackview-BV9600Pro.apk) in /system/overlay   
   > Overlay is raw copypasta from stock image and may need some tweak (for the notch especially)

You can probably flash the system with fastboot or SP Flash Tool directly but I didn't test.<br>
//25.12.2019 Tested. Flashing system directly with SP_Flash_Tool_v5.1916_Linux works. [@AreYouLoco?](https://github.com/AreYouLoco)
